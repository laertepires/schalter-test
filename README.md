# Study Project - Product List with Cart

This is a project developed for study purposes using Angular and Angular Material. The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to create an application that displays a list of products, allowing users to add or remove products from a shopping cart.

## Features

- **Product Listing:**  
  Displays a list of products with information such as name, description, price, and category.

- **Add/Remove Products from Cart:**  
  Allows users to add products to the cart and remove items. The cart counter, displayed in the sidebar, is updated dynamically.

- **Responsive and Modern Layout:**  
  Uses Angular Material to provide a modern and responsive interface.

- **Integration with a Mock API:**  
  The application communicates with a simulated API (using JSON Server) to retrieve the product list and manage the shopping cart.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular:** Framework for building web applications.
- **Angular Material:** UI component library for Angular.
- **RxJS:** Library for reactive programming.
- **JSON Server:** Simulates a REST API for testing and development purposes.
- **TypeScript:** Programming language used for the project.
